fuck me I deleted the whole lab after doing everything up to redirection...

Things I know don't work:

1. SIGINT / killing child processes isn't working 
2. not reaping dead children on loop
3. freeing mem, but valgrInd says i'm still leaking and can't find where:(
4. no extra credit completed 

Sources I consulted:

I affirm that I have adrhered to the honor code on this assignment
