fuck me I deleted the whole lab after doing everything up to redirection...

Things I know don't work:

1. SIGINT / killing child processes isn't working 
2. not reaping children
3. piping implemented, but output isn't getting writting to stdout and can't figure out why 
4. freeing mem, but valgrInd says i'm still leaking and can't find where:(
